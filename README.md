Rational minimax iterations for the pth root

This Mathematica notebook demonstrates a few results from "Rational Minimax Iterations for Computing the Matrix pth Root" by Evan S. Gawlik in Constructive Approximation, 54, 1-34, (2021).

The easiest way to view this notebook is to visit the Wolfram Notebook Archive:
