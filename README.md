### Rational minimax iterations for the pth root

This Mathematica notebook demonstrates a few results from "Rational Minimax Iterations for Computing the Matrix pth Root" by Evan S. Gawlik in Constructive Approximation, 54, 1-34, (2021). [ [pdf](http://math.hawaii.edu/~egawlik/pdf/Ga2019.pdf) | [doi](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00365-020-09504-3) ]

The easiest way to view this notebook is to visit the Wolfram Notebook Archive:

But one can also download the .nb file directly from here and open it with Mathematica.
